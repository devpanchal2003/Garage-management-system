                        <h3 style="color: black;"> SUSPENSION, BREAKS AND STEERING</h3>
                        <p style="color: black;"> Brakes and suspension systems are two of the most important parts of
                            your vehicle. Brakes
                            help you stop to avoid
                            accidents, while your suspension works to keep your vehicle under control.
                            If you have a problem with either, it's not only more inconvenient to drive - it's also
                            dangerous.
                            Don't risk your safety when you have symptoms of brake or suspension problems. Come to
                            Daddy's garage for complete and accurate inspections and diagnostics to find the
                            problem.</p>

                        <h3 style="color: black;">RUNNING REPAIRS</h3>

                            Transmission Belts, Exhaust

                        <h3 style="color: black;">CLUTCH REPAIR</h3>
                        <P style="color: black;">Clutches operate behind the scenes in many transmissions, including
                            automatics, but the word
                            clutch typically refers to
                            the component that connects and disconnects the engineâ€™s rotating crankshaft to a
                            traditional manual transmission. It
                            disconnects when the driver depresses the clutch pedal, selects a gear using the stick shift
                            and re-engages when the
                            pedal is released.</P>
